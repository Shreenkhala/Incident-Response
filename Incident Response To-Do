# Incident Response To-Do 

This list is designed to guide the creation, organization, and sharing of a comprehensive Incident Response repository on GitHub.

---

## 1. **Define Goals and Audience**
- [ ] Clearly define the purpose of the repository (e.g., to provide playbooks, tools, guides for incident response teams).
- [ ] Identify the target audience (e.g., SOC analysts, security engineers, IT admins).
- [ ] Research existing repositories to avoid duplication and find opportunities to improve.

---

## 2. **Organize the Repository Structure**
- [ ] Create a clear folder structure:
  ```
  /playbooks        # Incident response playbooks
  /tools            # Custom scripts or tools
  /guides           # Tutorials and best practices
  /templates        # Incident templates (e.g., RCA, incident logs)
  /resources        # External links, PDFs, and references
  ```
- [ ] Add a `README.md` file to describe the repository and its usage.
- [ ] Include a `LICENSE` file to specify the terms of use (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).

- [ ] Add issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` for:
  - [ ] Bug reports
  - [ ] Feature requests
  - [ ] Playbook suggestions
- [ ] Add a `CHANGELOG.md` file to track updates.

---

## 5. **Promote Collaboration**
- [ ] Open issues for community suggestions and improvements.
- [ ] Respond to pull requests and provide constructive feedback.
- [ ] Encourage contributions by labeling issues (e.g., `good first issue`).

---

## 6. **Promote the Repository**
- [ ] Write a blog post or LinkedIn article introducing the repository.
- [ ] Share on InfoSec forums, Slack communities, and Twitter.
- [ ] Submit the repository to curated lists (e.g., `awesome-infosec`).
