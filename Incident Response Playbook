## Introduction
This playbook provides step-by-step guidance for handling incidents that impact the reliability, security, or availability of systems and services. It is designed to help teams respond effectively to incidents, minimize downtime, and learn from past events.

---

## Objectives
- **Rapid Response**: Reduce the time to detect and resolve incidents.
- **Minimize Impact**: Contain and mitigate the effects of incidents on customers and stakeholders.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Implement lessons learned to prevent similar incidents.

## Roles and Responsibilities
| Role                | Responsibility                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Incident Manager** | Owns the incident, ensures the process is followed. |
| **Technical Lead**   | Investigates and resolves the technical aspects of the incident. |
| **Communications Lead** | Manages internal and external communications. |
| **Scribe**           | Documents the incident timeline and actions taken. |
| **Stakeholders**     | Informed about the incident's status and resolution. |

---

## Incident Severity Levels
| Severity Level | Description                              | Examples                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Critical**   | Major impact, requires immediate action. | System outages, security breaches. |
| **High**       | Significant impact, action needed soon.  | Major bugs, service degradation.   |
| **Medium**     | Moderate impact, manageable delays.      | Non-critical bugs, minor errors.   |
| **Low**        | Minimal impact, no immediate action required. | Cosmetic issues, minor inconveniences. |

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Preparation
- Maintain an **Incident Response Plan**.
- Set up **monitoring and alerting systems**.
- Conduct **regular training and drills**.
- Establish **communication channels** and escalation paths.

### 2. Detection and Analysis
- **Identify the Incident**: Detect anomalies via monitoring or user reports.
- **Classify the Incident**: Assign a severity level.
- **Gather Evidence**: Collect logs, metrics, and other relevant data.
- Create an **Incident Ticket** to track progress.

### 3. Containment
- **Immediate Actions**: Isolate affected systems or services.
- **Short-Term Fixes**: Apply temporary solutions to limit damage.

### 4. Eradication
- Perform **Root Cause Analysis** (RCA).
- Remove malicious files, configurations, or vulnerabilities.

### 5. Recovery
- Restore affected systems or services.
- Validate system integrity and functionality.
- Monitor for recurrence.

### 6. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct a **retrospective meeting** to analyze the incident.
- Document the **timeline, root cause, and resolutions**.
- Update playbooks and processes based on learnings.

---

## Communication Plans
- **Internal Communications**: Use Slack, Teams, or other tools for team coordination.
- **External Communications**: Notify customers and stakeholders via email, status pages, or social media.
- **Templates**:
    - Incident Announcement
    - Customer Notification
    - Incident Resolution Summary

---

## Incident Metrics and Reporting
Track the following metrics:
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Time taken to identify the incident.
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: Time taken to fully resolve the incident.
- **Number of Incidents**: Total incidents over a period.
- **Incident Recurrence Rate**: Percentage of recurring incidents.

---

## Tools and Resources
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic.
- **Incident Management**: PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Statuspage.
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom.
- **Documentation**: Confluence, Google Docs.

---

## Appendix
- **Glossary**: Define technical terms and acronyms.
- **Incident Templates**: Provide pre-defined templates for documentation.
- **Playbook Updates**: Log changes and updates to this playbook.
